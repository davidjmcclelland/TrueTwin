* A proof-of-concept connecting a physical device to a virtual twin via IoT technologies
* An apt demonstration of why it is critical to design devices to share data using a model that scales along dimensions of frequency and specificity to service many potential use cases efficiently.
* A loose illustration of the benefit of a digital twin to provide practical immersive training.
