#### Why Use Paho?

Paho is an MQTT client implementation maintained by the Apache Foundation. There are libraries available to ease integrating it into several languages. These aspects make it a good choice for a project where multiple popular languages will be used. There are differences between the languages but a lot of similarity in the implementations.

The Paho library will be useful to connect the Raspberry Pi GPIO interface with an MQTT server because it is available as a plugin for Python.&#x20;
