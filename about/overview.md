# Overview

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/PiCloudTwin4.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

TrueTwin is a collection of several sub-projects that are designed to work together to create a visceral connection between the physical world and a virtual one.&#x20;

[The list of projects used to build and support TrueTwin](https://github.com/stars/davidjmcclelland/lists/truetwin-project)

There are several goals that can be achieved by this project if it is completed successfully:

* A proof-of-concept connecting a physical device to a virtual twin via IoT technologies
* An apt demonstration of why it is critical to design devices to share data using a model that scales along dimensions of frequency and specificity to service many potential use cases efficiently.
* A loose illustration of the benefit of a digital twin to provide practical immersive training.
